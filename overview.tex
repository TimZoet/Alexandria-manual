%Type definitions and data stored in same database file.

The \marginlabel{See Section~\ref{section:library}.}\gls{library_class} class is the interface to a library file. It has methods for defining \marginlabel{See Section~\ref{section:types}.}types and their properties.

For each type definition you can create a matching C++ class. The member variables of this class correspond to the properties of the type. With the exception of some primitive types, special wrapper \marginlabel{See Section~\ref{section:classes}.}classes are needed to correctly read and write them.

The \marginlabel{See Section~\ref{section:object_handler}.}\gls{object_handler_class} class is the interface to instances of a specific type.  This class handles everything related to creating, retrieving, updating and deleting objects.

When exactly you define types and create instances of these types will of course depend on your use case. You could distribute an application with a complete library containing both types and data and never have the application modify it. Alternatively, you might have a library file with just types because your application generates data at runtime. Or perhaps the application creates wholly new library files and generates both the types and data at runtime.
